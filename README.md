# SDVX-Controller
This is a life size Sound Voltex (SDVX) Controller made with Arduino Pro Micro

## What is the goal?
The goal of this project is to create a life-sized SDVX Controller so that this video game is accessable to people without the arcade machine. Below this are some tasks that are required for this project to be successful: 

### Tasks
- Create a list of parts required and acquire them
- Create the dimensions of the casing
- Create a schematic diagram and pinout list
- Create the case using HDFs
- Assemble parts and circuit 
- Polish and finish the final product
